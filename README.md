# Artificial Intelligence for Land and Survey

Artificial Intelligence for Land and Survey is an AI assistant launched by Eyad Al-Naimi and Naser Diabat.

The project aims to assist Jordanian citizens by answering their questions about the Department of Land and Survey. It also showcases the teamâ€™s skills in building AI solutions using limited tools and resources.

ðŸ”‘ Key Techniques

- Semantic Caching â€“ speeds up responses by retrieving frequent questions directly from the FAQ knowledge base.

- Router LLM â€“ decides whether a user query belongs to the FAQ or requires searching the extended knowledge base.

- Reranker â€“ ensures only the most relevant documents are selected.

- Matryoshka Embeddings â€“ optimize search efficiency while minimizing information loss.

- Prompt Engineering â€“ ensures the model behaves as instructed.

- LLM via Perplexity API â€“ a large, fast model is used to provide users with the most accurate and high-quality answers possible.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Provide reliable and quick answers to citizen inquiries.

- Demonstrate AI innovation with limited resources.

- Highlight practical applications of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques.

ðŸ“Š Data Source

- The knowledge base was built using data extracted from the Legislations section of the official website of the Department of Land and Survey.
